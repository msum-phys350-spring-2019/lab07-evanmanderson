    Function to make a plot of motion of masses as a function of time. The time

    ----------

    x : array of position, N_times by 2 elements
        The array of positions, set up so that x[:, 0] is the position of mass
        1 relative to equilibrium and x[:, 1] is the position of mass 2.

        Times at which the positions have been calculated.

    title : str
        A descriptive title for the plot to make grading easier.
